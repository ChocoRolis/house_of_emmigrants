 Det är fortsättningen på intervjun med Milton Andersson till Everport Iowa. 28 januari 1986. Kassette 2, sida 1. De var de mesta. De var alla... Gud, vad hette han? Grampelbröd var en dekansk. Jag vet inte hur länge. Och med min far var han den mesta. I sommaren när en präster var gud eller präster fick sjuk så hade de aldrig tänkt på att hitta en annan präster för att ta sitt ställe. Dekanskade hade en präster. Jag kan ihåg att han präste några gånger, men sen blev han lite för gud. Och sen var det min pappa som gjorde det. Gustaf Johnson var den enda som gjorde det, oavsett min pappa. Men jag kan ihåg att han präste några gånger. Så länge han bara blev så gud att han inte ville vara där längre. Hur gammal var din pappa när han kom på chansen? Har du några rekommender? Jag skulle inte vara förvånad om att han var en dekansk från tiden den där chansen var organiserad. Jag kan inte ihåg någon gång när han inte var det. Han var en väldigt personlig vän av Grandlands. Han var första minister. De var på vår plats och vi var på Parsonage, samma sak med Petersons. Jag vet inte om någon annan här vet om Ant-Norma vet eller inte. Som jag kan ihåg var han på chansen. Han var en kvardirektör. Han var den enda kvardirektören eftersom jag gick. Och efter 25 år? De gav honom en kvart. Jag sa det tidigare. Det var hans pappa för alla de senaste åren. Det var väldigt unikt för en liten landskur. Vi kallar det en liten landskur, men Fresco var en liten landskur. Bankernas vän var musikmedelare vid Luther och en fin organist. Hon kunde gå åt alla platser och vara organist. Hon var en väldigt personlig vän av mina pappa. Hon och hennes hundgång. Hans vän var banker. Det hjälpte mycket. Det verkar som om det här området var väldigt musikmedelare. Kan du verkligen lära musik eller måste du ha det? Varför är det så fett att få så många med talent? Jag måste välja att det inte var för många utanför min relation. Sylvia, Johnsons och Rube Isakson. Och Sylvias pappa, han sa att det inte var många utanför mina familjer. I alla fall två eller tre familjer. Varför kom det all det? Vem är responsabel för det? Min pappa och hans sista Emma var det ena i familjen. Min mamma och alla bröder, August bröder var de särskilt mindre. Avild och Edith var väldigt bra. Men Persons och Nelsons var där när de var. Och Wallyeens. Jag vet inte. Var de alla spelade instrument? Ja, min pappa hade en liten kornettband. Han var den första att bryta sig från det. Han var den första klärnet-spelaren. Och en av min mammas kunder var Elmer Persons. De var de första två woodwind-spelaren i vårt samhälle. Det var helt fantastiskt. Och de var självbildade. Alla var självbildade. Jag tänker på min mamma och hans äldre bröder. Han var en kornett-spelare. Han hade en av de lilla kornetten. Han spelade kornett-spelaren som en pro. En liten äldre bröder, du vet. Han kom in och varmade sig på att spela kornett-spelaren. Kan du tro det? Jag har pratat så att jag blev blå i fönster. Jag kunde aldrig göra så mycket som han gjorde. Här hade jag musikuppdrag och kunde spela och organisera band. Jag hade tillgång till de som var talenterade. De hade någon i kommunen som tog upp en stek och spelade Susa Martinsson. Vi spelade efter världens andra värld. Du har en band som står i Sarasja. Ja. Jag direktade en sommar efter världens andra värld. Vi stod på en farma i sommaren. De var fortfarande... Min mamma och hans äldre... Elmer och Herman. Det var på en sattelare eller sönder du spelade i Bensland? Nej, vi har en rehearsal på morgon och konsert på vänster. Storarna var öppna på vänster. Och så kom folk till? Ja, folk kom. Var det en sattelare eller en rehearsal? Båda. När det började hade de en bandstånd på vänster. Det var på middelintersektionen i town. Groceries och hårdvarustor i en korn. Där spelade vi. Du har ju flyttat längre. Sen kunde de ta bort den i en stånd på en städpark. De tog bänkarna på en farmas koop. Sen kunde man ta bort den och sitta i bilen. Men när den var på den yttersta intersektionen... Det var ett litet problem. När trafiken blev värre kunde de ta bort den. Sen var den permanent. Hur många kunder var det där? 30. När de började, när jag började... De hade ingen band i högskolan. I de gamla 20-talet. Och 30-talet där på Tresco. Nej, när mina sista var på högskolan... De hade band i högskolan. Sen fick de mindre barn. Men vi skulle gå... Jag kan ihåg att en år senare... Vi spelade på ett städfärg. Vi hade ungefär 40. Det var fantastiskt. De hade sina egna instrumenter. En av Truids, Konstantin Truid... Han var Alfred Truid, missionär i Kina. Han var den första flutplågaren vi hade i Tresco. När de kom tillbaka från Kina... Konstantin var born i Kina. När de kom tillbaka, de levde i Tresco... ...när hans pappa var recupererade... ...för att de kom till Strassberg. Han var den första flutplågaren vi hade i Tresco. Det var enstående. Jag vet inte om de hade en obo-plågare. Så du bröt in något nytt? Ja, saxofonter vi hade. Var de också alla svenska nu? De var alla bland. De har alla musikaler. Även några av de här människorna... ...som jag sa var från Treskoslovakien... ...som är fortfarande uppe. De kom från där. Min pappa hade några goda vänner uppe. Han var en teen innan han blev märk. Han spelade med några av dem. De var Treskoslovakierna? De Bohemianerna var katholiska. Var de samma katholiska som italiener eller ert? Jag tror det. Jag tror att det inte var en bra känsla... ...bland de iriska och Bohemianerna. Det var som Mission Covenant och Lutus. I Davy var de iriska katholiska. I Oahu var det en djupskabla. I Weston var de Bohemianer katholiska. De var alls lite indipendenta. Hur var Lutus? Dade de några av de andra nationaliteten? Ja. Där fick man leva ihop med en. Jag försöker tänka på vem den ena var. Vi hade en dag per vecka... ...med en prövningsförsvars eller så. Och det var en man... Jag vet inte om ni kan ihåg var han var. Och sen fick Cesar gå till kappeln. Men han skulle inte komma till prövningsförsvarsmedlemmen. Var han katholisk? Jag vet inte. Jag måste se på min... Jag tror jag fick en annuär. De hade inga... Det var bara utrymme. De presterade. Det var en annan kirka. Det var en kappel. Det var en kärna. Ja, det var det. Och jag vet inte hur jag fick börja. Jag skulle ta behov på en del... ...eller en röda. När jag fick Augie hade jag att göra samma sak. Du var en vän som jag. Jag hade att ta det in. Jag skulle säga att det var old Dean Wald. Han var där och gjorde säkert att jag tog det in. Jag skrattar fortfarande om detta. Jag vet inte vad jag sa. Det var någon... ...eller en aktet eller en boyskortett. Jag tog mig in en dag. Jag markade en man som var absent. Dean Wald vet inte att han var på scenen. Han sjöde på en kappel. Men hans sida var öppet. Den dagen så checkade han mig. Jag lär aldrig förlora det. Du vet att det måste ha varit... ...500 människor på kappeln. Du måste ha de tänden? Nej, bara en del. Anderson var där och fram... ...och till en sida. Jag hade så många röda. Jag markade inte denna dag att han var absent. Han var på scenen och sjöde på en aktet. Vad gjorde de om de skrattade? Jag vet inte. Jag skulle ha kallat Dean Wald på en kappel. Jag skulle ha kunnat uttrycka honom. Jag tror det. Det har ändrats mycket. Ja, det är klart. Det är sant. Hur är det med de här byggnaderna i Ceresko? De har några stål och en bank. Var de opererade av svenskar? I Ceresko och andra byggnader? Nej, det enda som var dominerat av svenskar... ...var Farmers Co-op. När jag gick upp... ...falle det av Blomström. Han tränade en annan som var Moir. Han tog över. Han började jobba där när han kom från högskolan. Sen kom han. Han har bara reti. Det var första gången de hade en manager på en elevator... ...med en skolskolig education som var tränad för det. De resten hade varit tränade på jobbet. De hade en lumbargård och så vidare. Det var formen av de farmarna? Ja, min pappa var regering på en elevator i år. De jobbade bra? Ja. 1, 2 och 3. Efter World War II... eller 1. 1919-1920. Farmers Co-op. Jag försöker tänka på Al Lundström där han jobbade. Det var en annan elevator. Hur gick det med garage? Var det inte så svenska? Ja, det var svenska. Men det var allt. Ingen stor? Ingen svensk. Banken. Men ingen skolstor. Ingen skolstor? Blaksmys? Arvid Swanson var overland! Hur var det med doktorer och dentister? Dockorer? Ingen svenska. Vi hade en doktor. Ingen dentister. Vi hade gått till Oahu. Tio mil. Kan du ihåg några svenska emigrer? Min far, på det här sättet, på vår visite till Sverige, min far hade en kund. Hans äldre bror kastade sig till Sverige. Han kom till Sverige när hans far kom. Hans äldre bror kastade sig. En av mina kunder kom till Sverige. En av mina farans kunder från Sverige. En liten liten äldre än min far. Han jobbade på min far. På min farans far. Sen fick han bli trött. Så de talade om en annan kunder. Han var en annan kund. Den första kunden var Peter Carlsen. De talade om en annan kunder. Det var i 1927. Han hette Okey Andersson. Det var på Andersson-sidan av familjen. När han kom, efter Christmas, och för att hjälpa honom att lära engelska, kom han till vårt landskolag. Han var ungefär 18 år när han kom. Han stod här fem år. Min far, hans äldre bror, kom till att fara. De var fortfarande hård. Okey var en fin, fin kunder. En hård jobbare och en bra far. Han kunde hård i vintertiden. Annars skulle han bara göra skåren. Vad betalade de? En dollar per dag? Just i armen. I vintertiden, när han inte kunde jobba på en far, betalade de inte. De betalade henne. Han stod med henne och gjorde hans lager. Sen kunde han hård i vintertiden. Eller kunde han hudda och göra hölj. Han stod här fem år och sen kom han till Sverige. Men för att han kom till Sverige kunde han inte hitta en kund. Han kom till Sverige och blev sjuk. För någon eller annan reason. Han gick till sjukhuset och jag tror han var här i fyra eller fem månader eftersom han hade märkt en nörd. Vi hade mött henne. Han stod i Sverige. Han var en stor far i Sverige. Han gick till Sverige och gillade kök. Han hade ett dörrbarn. Det var ganska stort. Han gillade det. Han hade de färger som är typiska i Sverige. Många lilla gröder och dörrbarnen. Han hade färger och färger. Jag har aldrig sett en mer glada färg i mitt liv. Han hade tagit ut alla mörk. Han sa att de här var planerade fem år sen. Det här är tio år. Det här är femton år. Det här är 20 år. En av de saker som gick med honom, det laget i Sverige, var att man hade att ha access till publiken. På andra sidan av hans forst var det en länk. Han hade att ha en access-röda från den stora röda genom hans forst till länken. Nån kunde komma där varje gång de ville. De skulle stå där hela natt och hela tiden. Det var riktigt vackert. Han hade två hus, de var äldre än 100 år på faran. Han hans mor var där och de var på andra huset. De gjorde en del av faran. Han hade reti. Han hade en väldigt modern hus. De hade remodellat en äldre hus. Om han hade hittat en gud i Ceresko, hade han stått där? Jag skulle inte bli förvånad. Jag skulle inte. Men han kunde inte. Var alla pågående på Ceresko? Han var för äldre. Han gick till Svedbergskirken. Min äldre pappa och sista fortsatte gå till Svedbergskirken. Det var fler svenskar uppe. Men han kunde inte hitta några. För någon annan skall han få sjuk eller ha penicid. Han var inte tillbaka i fyra eller fem månader. Han var med sin nörd. Vi lät om det. Det var kul. Han och jag satt där och gav så länge vi hade tröjan i våra ögon. När var han? 1976. Och han död. Han död snart efter. Han var 75 år. Han var... Jag var bara 13 år när han kom. Hur var det att bli född i det området där du var född? Fanns det som i de städerna? Inte riktigt. Jag tänker på det. Du var självständig på formen. Vi hade alltid något att äta. Det enda jag... Ja, jag talade med dig om det. Jag tror att det var 35. Vi hade inga kvarpratis. Vi hade kvarpratis vid sundskolan. Det borde några. Adolfarna skulle gå till sundskolan också. Vi skulle ta 10 gallon krim och 30 dögn ägg. Vi talade med en vän på söndagsfärd. Han kunde äggen och testade krim. Min pappa gick till en släpp av vad han ville. Han gick tillbaka efter köket och tog upp. Om han hade lite kvarpratis så kunde han köpa lite kand. Jag kan ihåg att min pappa hade en dollar kvarpratis. Han fejlade för en vecka efter det. Men vi köpte mest med sugare och salt. Vi hade vanillin, för vi hade vår egen hemsida. Jag tror att vi gjorde äggkrim åtminstone en vecka. Vi hade alla nödvändiga ingredienser, except for the sugar and the vanilla. And the salt too. Men jag kan inte ihåg... Så du kunde bara åka tillbaka en vecka? Ja, vi tog just bilen. En vecka. På en sorgmorgon. And they talked the grocery into being open. Just for you then? Well, a lot of other people. Oh yes. Asking what was gasoline, about 15 cents a gallon? Oh, it was 10 at one time. You said you delivered eggs in all. Did you have the candled eggs before you left them at the store? No, they did it. They did it at the store, yes. You traded your cream and eggs for your groceries, which you really did. But you know, if you picked eggs every day, you didn't have to worry about them. Once in a while we'd find a nest in a hay mower some place. I'd get an old hen, you know. Occasionally, you know, that would happen. So they would tell you then? Oh yes, yes. But if you picked them every day and kept track of them, why... What did you cool them on in the summer days? We never did. We never cooled eggs, did we? No, no, we never did. Did you go a week? Well, we had a cellar. I think we kept eggs in the cellar. Now, you think about it, we had the ice house, so we had an ice box. But now, in between times, you know, we'd have a tank where the windmill would pump the water into the tank. And then from that tank it would overflow and run to the stock tank. And we'd put the cream and butter in that tank. And you know, the windmill would be running most all day. In Nebraska there was usually wind. Yeah, but then, you know, in those days we didn't have frozen meat, you know. You had cured hams and cured bacon and dried beef. And then you canned the beef. Like you make stew out of it or... And pork chops and things, but you couldn't keep them like you do nowadays. Of course, we had chicken. And you know, you'd think you'd get tired of it, but you didn't. We'd have two or three times a week, especially when the fires get big enough, you know. And we never got tired of it. At least I didn't. It was prepared right. Tasty. So you had a lot of... did you have your own smokehouse then? Oh yes, yeah. That was part of my job. I was just talking to my daughter about it about a week ago. That was part of my job. We used some cedar branches. Yeah, that was quite a ritual. To butcher a hog and a beef before spring work started. Before spring? Before, you know, when it was still cold. And leave it hang out in a corncree valley overnight to cool off. Then you start canning it or start smoking it and drying it. Did you salt anything down? Oh yes, yes, yes. That too. I suppose mostly pork chops. No, you know what we did? You fried them and then you put them in a big crock with lard and then you covered them with lard. And they kept it. And they kept, but you fried them first. And then when you take them out you'd have to heat them up. That's all. Didn't you ever do that? Yeah, that's what we did. That's how we kept the pork chops. But you know, we never had steak in the summertime because you couldn't keep it. There was no way to keep it. No. No barbeque. How about now in the wintertime before Christmas? Did you also slaughter? Oh yes, oh yes. Sometimes, you know, if the weather wasn't just right, you know, busy picking corn. But if you were busy picking corn and you got through, you didn't butcher until after you got through picking corn. But if you had some bad days when it was stormy or snowy, then you'd always butcher. Oh yes, you had to butcher before Thanksgiving. Fresh meat all winter long. So you had a lot of relations now around there, so you often came together for dinner. Oh yes, yes. And cake. Sunday afternoons. Oh yes. But there was no work done on the farm around Sunday? No, never. You know, my mother's sister, one of my mother's sisters, Alfie, her youngest sister married a German man. And they were farmers. So grandpa and grandma went down there. I guess they talked to their daughter on Saturday night. Grandma said, well, see you in church Sunday. You know, just natural. So my aunt says, well, we're not going to church tomorrow. Why? Well, the wheat's ripe and Ed thinks he has to cut the wheat tomorrow. Boy, oh boy, Sunday morning. We couldn't figure out like seven o'clock. Here grandpa and grandma and my mom's youngest brother tearing down the road. Like seven o'clock. We were just getting up for breakfast. It was the only day we ever slept late. And they went down there by a George. My mom's youngest sister and her husband were in church that Sunday morning. That's the only time that ever happened in our family when I grew up. So there was new ideas coming in. And grandpa says the Lord will give you the best yield you ever had if you wait till tomorrow. There'll be nothing wrong with it. And I guess that wheat tested like 61. A couple points, three points higher than it needed to. Were there differences in the matter of farming between German, Slovak, and the Bohemians and the Swedes? Not too much. They follow the same pattern. Can I see two? Side two. There was no field tiling down there. Oh no. There was no down? No. Was there needed or? Well you see, there wasn't any level land out there. Really. You have to get out by Stronnsberg. There's no big tile and things like that. Yeah, I guess maybe they do. And then after I left before they started soil conservation and terracing. My father started when he was still farming. Was this the state then? What? Was this the state of Nebraska or was it a county? Oh no, just individual. On your own, yes. Some of them never did. Some of them did more than others. What did they have to do then when they started that? Well you see, hilly and so instead of planting rolls up and down the hills, they went, they had terraces. And they went across the land instead of up and down the hills. Did somebody come out and told them what to do? No. Well did they have extension aids? Well they had extension agents in the state farm and they had the Nebraska farmer. And there would be people like, who was it? Bill Pearson. Some of them did terracing professionally. They'd hire out and they'd go out and terrace farms for the farmers. Did they believe in that at first or were they restrictive to it? Well, no, they started to believe it because they saw other people doing it. The Russian? Oh yes. There was a big push during the 30s, during Franklin Roosevelt's administration, right? Yes. And that really made people aware of it. But your land, was it in the part of the Dust Bowl? Well we got dust from Oklahoma. No, it really wasn't. It was too far east. Farther north, a lot of that came from the south. It came from Oklahoma and Kansas. No, not too much. Can you imagine sitting there, you know, in Lincoln, Nebraska, north of Lincoln, Nebraska, and see the crazy red clay from Oklahoma blowing way up there. Just regular grits in the ditches. You know, you can tell it wasn't arse oil because ours was black. It was just red clay and it had to come from Oklahoma. Because you see it when you go to Oklahoma, you can see it. Just amazing. But there was no pressure. No, there were some people, you know, there were some people and it never did. Not too early, said Pam's grandpa. He never did. I can remember, I suppose it was in 35 or 36, it was so hot and dry by Memorial Day, which would have been May 30th, that our cemetery was just burned to crisp. The grass was already at the end of May. And that was in one of those years, 33 maybe 35. That's how hot and dry it was. The only thing that saved us was that the wells didn't go dry. Thank goodness. There is plenty of water in Nebraska. Well, there has been irrigation right now. I don't know what it would be like now. Was your wells dug by hand? No. Now where I lived in eastern Nebraska, north of Lincoln, our wells were like less than 100 feet deep. Now where she lives, you know, they're 200 or more. Those are drilled. Ours were, they just have a pipe that goes down, but ours were casings, this big. When were they dug then? Like your father and all? Well, I suppose they were dug in the 1890s. But they were dug by hand though? No, they weren't dug by hand. Well, where Leif lives they were. That one was only about 25 feet deep. But they had big augers eventually. Horse drawn? Yeah, horse drawn, that they did. Now ours was, where we lived, it was their farm. People would stop at our place and fill up their jugs during thrashing because that water was so soft. And Grandpa Willeans, that was terrible water. Oh, yeah, just terrible. And just a quarter of a mile away. And right where their farm was, it was cool and soft. As I say, people would sneak in our place and fill their jugs during thrashing rather than a couple other places where it wasn't nearly as good. Well, I suppose thrashing time, that way you need a lot of water. Oh boy. Those were big days. Yes. And the farmers or neighbors came together? Oh yes. Yes, we had a thrashing rig of our own. The farmers owned it. And it was a steam thrashing, a steam engine, and a large separator. Oh, like 72 inch straw rack and 36 inch is where you grain end of it. And you could, two of you, could pitch as many bundles in there as fast as you could. You couldn't slow it down unless it was wet and mud on it. Yes, but it couldn't sort it off then, so it didn't go in the straw. Yes. The grain sort it off? Oh no, not this big machine. If the grain was dry it didn't. And I hauled water several years for that. And it was my first big job, five dollars a day. Can you imagine? But guess what time I went to work? Four a.m. guess what time it got done? Nine maybe. Nine? At night, depends upon the dew. How far did you have to haul the water? Well, it depended on the farmer's wells. At our place, you know, we just went to the farmer's wells. But a couple farms I had to go to the creek west, Rock Creek west. And then you had to be a little off by hand then? Well, you pump it. You pump it? And you couldn't take a full tank because the horses couldn't pull it up the bank. Then you go and unload it and go right back. Holy yuck! Then in between times I had a shovel of coal. We had a coal bin on the engine and I had to keep that full. And of course the farmers, they didn't have to buy the coal. The company that owned the thrash machine, they bought the coal. Of course all the farmers owned it. But the farmers had to go to town and get it. And then they'd have it standing in a wagon. And then I'd have to go and get my horses and hook up to that wagon and haul it out to the steam engine. Was that big chunk coal? No, no. It wasn't hard coal. It was kind of halfway in between. It wasn't soft coal, it wasn't hard coal, sort of halfway. And then I'd have to shovel it up on the engine. We had a coal bin in the engine. Oh boy. One of my mom's cousins that owns the Wallin farm, he ran the thrash machine. And another one, the broad grandson of this one, he ran the steam engine. Oh boy. Oh boy. Again self-taught. They had a good job of the person to run the engine. He was a little bit hired up and the rest of them. Yeah. Of course we had a whistle on it, just like a freight train. But you had to fire that thing up at four o'clock. Oh sure, four o'clock in the morning to get the steam up. Ready to go by sun up or whatever. And then we'd go and have breakfast. We also had breakfast where we were going thrash that morning. And was that usually in October, November? Oh no, August, July. And wheat then? Yeah, and oats too. No, we'd start, it depend on when the farmers got through cultivating the last time. We started in July and August, depends on. And then you hauled in the sheaves? Yeah, hauled in the bundles. We had eight racks. And boy, I tell you, if it was dry, they could hardly keep up. And we'd go and have a chat. Yes, put them together. So how many were thrashing hard like this? 15, 20? No, well, yeah. There were twelve farmers, way till the end of that, that owned it. And eight of them hauled bundles and then the rest of them would help haul grain, you know. And then some of them would stack the straw. And sometimes we'd blow the straw in a hay shed or in a hay mall. And they had to be up there. And then of course your mother, two or three. Two or three people helping them. Can you imagine? Oh, you bit coffee in the morning and afternoon. Oh, yes. And then imagine frying chicken for fifteen guys. And that would probably eat half a chicken a piece almost. And pies and then you used the old range, you know, wood or cobs and hot chicken. My mom would always be, she was one, they always knew they had pie at my mom's place. And fried chicken. Well, we're going to be tending to that house tomorrow. And they always knew that, that they had fried chicken and pie at our place. Well, that's where they got well known. That's for sure. Plus one place where they didn't get very good food. They always knew about that too. I bet it was a hard time for many to keep up with so many people in the... Oh, yes. How about the women? Did they have the same right as a man? I mean, do we pay the same wages if they were paid as a man? Women weren't paid. Well, I suppose you exchanged for them during the day. Women didn't work at any paying jobs. And neighbors would help each other with the cookies. Yeah, they'd help each other. And when we'd shuck corn and take up hay. They were never off the field? Oh, no. None of our relatives were. None of them worked in the field. My sisters once in a while would help us cut sunflowers or cocklebers. Well, my sister was older. She was the oldest in our family. And she used to drive a tractor because there weren't any boys big enough. And she did drive for my dad when he was out in the field. But now around my home, I don't know of any girls that did, really. They all had older brothers or the father was able to do it themselves. But the only work my sisters did on the farm, we'd go through the corn fields and cut sunflowers or cocklebers. Did they help us with corn? We helped with the corn. No, Margaret and Betty never did. Maybe because my sister and I were the oldest. It could be. No, they never did. And you didn't get paid for it actually? No, no. That was just part of your job in the family. But when you were going out for a job, not like being a woman, did you get the same pay then at that time? Did you ever realize she is just a woman, she doesn't need the same pay as the man? Well, now women went into different kinds of jobs. You see, you were going to be a teacher or a nurse. And that was all women. And I'm sure the pay wasn't maybe as great. And you didn't find many men teachers, maybe principals or superintendents. But just a regular teacher, there weren't very many. Boy, you know, I can't think of any women. When I grew up in our relatives, they had any jobs except my cousin Wilma was the first nurse. And Hvald was the first one that went to town and worked at a bank. Now they were both... He was my second cousin and this other gal, she was my age, six months older than I am. She was a nurse. And those were the first two. And this whole family that left the farm. And then of course after that, after World War II, and the younger generation. It was a different kind of old. When I was going to Sweden, this first cousin of my father that came to America, this Pete Carlson, that was in the...oh, right after World War I. He had a niece in Sweden that kept writing to him. And so we did have an address and we were able to contact her. Those people, all we had from those people on my mother's side of the family was obituaries. Like we had Brudda Torp and Lena Perish and... No letters from anybody? No, no letters. We don't even know if there's any relatives. But we did know my father's family on both sides, his father and his mother. We did know that there were people there. But we didn't know them and all we had was this one lady who kept writing to Pete Carlson. It was his niece, she's younger, but she wrote in Swedish. And her father was a brother of this Pete Carlson. And he was the one that collected all the inheritance. And the first time we were there in 1976 he was still living. Then she got us connected with my father's father's family. Now, they had just retired at that time. They were in their early 80s. And they had moved to a small town. He took me out to the farm and this farm had been in the Anderson family My grandfather was a child in Sweden in the 1850s. So this cousin of my father's moved to town, left everything out on the farm. Pictures on the wall, dishes in the cabinet, tablecloths on the table. Just left it and moved to town. We'd go out to a back porch on the farm. You know, you put storm windows on in the summertime, in the summertime you got screens. They had an old kitchen cabinet out there. They had milk, come here. The old Lisa didn't know it. July 1875, my grandfather's first letter that he wrote back to Sweden when it came to the United States. And that's this one. That's his first letter. And here they had them. You can imagine, it took me, I tell you, the tears in my eyes I could hardly see when I think about that. In the fall, plowing a wheat stubble. Fred. He ran into a swarm of bees. And of course, you know, he had the horses and he had a straw hat. And he was fighting the bees off and stuff. And so he stopped, he wasn't too far from the house, he stopped and came in the house, I guess, for a drink of water to wash his face or something. And collapsed and died. And it was out there in the... In Nebraska. In Nebraska. But the rest of them all, but this man here, very active, very strong lay leader in the Augustana Church. That's a true thing there. A very strong leader in the Lutheran Church. And went to conventions. I've got a thing here that I... Oh boy. Shouldn't have done this. He was known as... Andrew Gustav. Yeah, and he was a good friend of Oglin and Seashore. And anyway, I've got some place here. Oh boy. Mulserid. Algona. So he also attended the Lutheran Academy. Yes. But he was needed at home. Yeah. So he had to come back then. Yes. And he became a farmer and all that. Never married. But he was a good... Very well thought of, but a fine church leader. And always went to conferences. And of course when the Synod was close enough, he'd get to there, you know. And his association with Terrell and Galin and Seashore, he and Galin were just like two buddies. Just like your best friend. And they would go... And, oh, you should hear. They'd talk sweet. And they would laugh and laugh. Now Andrew never learned to drive. So this nephew of his that came from Sweden, this Pete Carlson that came earlier, he drove him all around. But then Galin would come down. And he never had a culimeter that he could ride. He had a walking culimeter as long as he lived till he was 75 years old. Can you imagine? And he was the representative for Dagestan and Bookinghamn out there in the area. So he sold like Dagestan and the different... Books and Bibles. And Bethphagy Mission in Exdel. Yeah, he went on train out to Exdel one time, to Bethphagy. I remember that. Yeah, he was quite a guy. He walked a lot of miles. Oh boy, you know what he did. And we never could figure out why he never learned to drive. Now his next brother, Oscar, well he drove like a mad man. So they were all different? Yeah, they certainly were. Were they all religious inclined? Yes, every one of them. All of them? All of them. This would be interesting for you. This girl here. Her name is Gusty. And... I don't know the story. But she started working in Lincoln, Nebraska. As a maid and a cook. Worked for millionaires. Oh boy, you know when we were kids we would just love to go down there. And we'd go down there and stop and see her. And if her boss was around the owner or something, he'd slip us a dollar bill. I'm talking about 1925, 26, you know, men a kid. Nine year old kid, you know, getting a dollar bill in 1927. While you were on your way to your first million. And the way we would eat when we'd get there, he'd come and say, Gusty, have you got some food for him? What was his living? Bankers, I don't know what he was. And she did that until she was, I guess in her 60s. This gal never figured out why she never married. She was the most popular gal in our community. Tell the girls she could sing by the piano. Never married. She stayed home then? Yes, stayed home. Now Alice, she worked, but mostly for people close around home. But this was the gal. She has eight children. A couple of her kids are my age. They're very good friends of mine. I still write letters to them here from Christmas. And he was postmaster. He was a banker. All the rest I'm farmers. How about politics now? Republicans. Oh yes, all Republicans. No Democrats? I don't know. When I grew up, I don't think I even knew a Democrat. Honest. Most of the Democrats were the... Why was it like that? I don't know if it was the philosophy or the people or what. Now the first Democrats that I knew were these Irish Catholics that lived on... See, we lived practically on the county line, Lancaster, which is Lincoln, Nebraska. And this was Davy. And they never elected a Republican down there. And around Sresko and Sweetberg. If you weren't a Republican, you just will not run. So like your brother, no, he was a Republican. He was running on the ticket. All time. Were all Swedes running the politics in your area? Mostly. We were laughing about the county commissioner. I remember one time a guy from Weston, and that was the Bohemian Catholics. They got a guy in there, the county commissioner. And they used to laugh and laugh about it. But he'd come, you know. And unless the Swedes supported him, he never got any place. Just no place at all. We had five commissioners in the Saanen's commune. And four of them were Swedish. He didn't have a chance, poor guy. And they stayed like that for many, many years? Oh yes, many years. They stayed that way at least until World War II. Even during the Hoover era? Oh yes, yes. So they were still Republicans? Oh yes, yes. No, they didn't like Hoover. Oh boy, how they hated Roosevelt. Well, he probably couldn't help it either, boy. How they hated Roosevelt. Was that anything of him? Oh no. Not at all. Oh, I remember that. That was so funny. Because you see, 1935 of course. Did you question the political outlook at the time? No, not really. Because of my background. Grandparents, parents, church and all that. So you never questioned the authority of the elderly? No, until I got to Auggie. Oh, but they were also Republicans. Oh yes. That's for sure. And then I told you this. My main outside interest at Auggie was 1st Lutheran and Malene. With Lindholm, you know. And I had the Luther League choir down there and sang in the choir. So I really got it. We laugh about that. We still have a supper club. And those people that we first knew. That's when Elmer Copely was still at Auggie. And then those days we had what we call young oldsters. And not all of them were married. But we still have a supper club of eleven couples. Copely was the one that moved to Bethlehem. But we still have this supper club of eleven couples. That we all started at 1st Lutheran and Malene. One in Bettendorf and a couple in Rock Island. And then we live here in Davenport. And we meet once a month. We never miss. But Beck and I, you are a Republican. Did you have any politicians coming in there for some speeches? Not really. Because they were so solid already. No, I really... I think one time, all the time I grew up or all the time I was home. My dad came home from a school board meeting one time. Really hot under the collar. Somebody was trying to agitate. And he made a comment about it. He said, well, what can you expect from a Democrat? And that was the only time I ever... Until I left home in summer 1938... That I ever heard them really get excited about anything. And this was a school board. Country school, like that. And you know, that's really saying something. But that's the kind of community that I grew up in. And the whole county was... Both Saunders and Lancaster were Republican. Oh, Lancaster wasn't so much. No? No, not so much. I suppose maybe 60 percent Republican, but not as strong as Saunders County. And of course you get out to Polk County, you know. Out for Strömsbergen, Oslo and Sweden. Why, they were... I hardly dared admit you were Democrat out there. I doubt if you were a Democrat out on the Swedenholm area out there. They'd even let you on the farm roads. Oh, goodness. They were, even when I went to Luther, you could really tell when those people came. Especially the Swedenholm and Strömsbergen people. They were real conservative. They were? Oh, yes. You'd be needed for your orientation. Oh, yes. I'm talking about, you know... Well, I started Academy in 1930. And then, 35 was the last year I was a freshman at Augie. And you could see it. Oh, I think about one fellow. My goodness. He was a long, long time county commissioner out there. And I think the only reason he isn't now, he just decided he retired, just got tired of it. And he was a classmate of mine at Luther.
