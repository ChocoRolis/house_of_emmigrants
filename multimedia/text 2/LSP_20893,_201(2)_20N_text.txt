 Jag kan inte ihåg varför min far var i vilken stad han var nu. Jag kan inte ihåg hans... Jag tror att det var nära Omaha. Omaha, Nebraska, eller nånstans. Vissa var där. Jag vet inte vilken stad det var. Men hon hade en äldre som hon jobbade för där i Omaha. I Idaho. Han hade en stor farm. Och hon kom 1981? 1989. Som din far. Ja. Jag sitter tillsammans med Carl Moberg i Belle Grande, Vännisberg, Washington. Han var född 1907, 19 september i Hammer, N.A. Och det här är oktober 17, 1982. Och om jag frågar dig... De tog upp till N.A. då? Ja, jag tror att de tog från Nebraska till Minnesota. Medan de tog upp till Minnesota först? Ja, och sen tog de till N.A. Och det här stället i N.A. är Hammer? Det är en av de ökade ställen? Ja, en ökad hetsfarm. Vi hade en hetsfarm i Homstead där. Och du var född där? Ja. Vad kan du ihåg från stället? Jag var bara 4 år gammal, så jag kan inte ihåg något. Du kan inte ihåg något? Nej, jag kan ihåg bara en liten snö. Vad gjorde Gerdie när de gick till skolan? De vad? När Gerdie gick till skolan. Ja, de hade slägarna där. Horsar? Horsar med en buffalo-klipp för att hålla frysen. För att det var ner i 40-talet i vintertiden. Men du var för liten att ihåg? Ja, jag kan inte ihåg något att ihåg något där. Det nästa talet var hemma. Jag tror att det var en annan, Warwick. Warwick? Jag tror det var nästa. Jag tror att de var mellan de två. Hur kom han över sin farm? Var det en Homstead som han tog in? Ja, han tog upp en Homstead. 160-hjular? Ja, han hade en fullgång hetsfarm. Och de byggde sin hus där? Ja, de byggde bilar där. Och du var född 1907, så det betyder att de stod där i några år? Ja, jag kan inte ihåg vilken år de började Homstead. Men vi stod där i 1911. 1911? Jag var född 1907. Och vad var då denna gång? Min pappa tog en likning till detta här. Hur gjorde han det där? Han hade en äldre här. Han levde här uppe. Han hade 10-hjular. Och jag vet inte, någon gång fick han tala om att det här var ett plats att leva. Det skulle vara ett bra plats att leva. Här i Vännisfjord? Ja. Var det kallt Vännisfjord då? Ja. Ja, det var det. Det har aldrig fått en annan namn. Vännisfjord, ja. Så han fick kontakt med några real estate-developerare? De skulle ha fått det här. Landerberg och Andersson jobbade utifrån Portland. Där hade de deras real estate-office. Vad var namnet? Andersson? Ja, Andersson. Ja, Landerberg och Andersson. Land development company. Ja, det var Swedish land and colonization. Swedish land and colonization company. Det var Andersson och Landerberg. De var de två real estate-office. De har köpt det här området? Ja. Så de fick kontakt med land-companyet? Ja. Så de fick kontakt med land-companyet? Ja. Så han köpte här hur många? Tio, tio akor. Var de alla de satsen de hade på formen här? Ja, några hade tvåtio. Tio akor på tvåtio. Tio, tjugo, tjugo, tjurde. Det var en drastisk tjänst då. Kommer från Norrkåren med hundra akor. Ja, de hade 160 där. Och de var alla klart för stömmen så länge? Ja. Ja, uppe där. Här kom de till en annan situation. Så vad såg han då när han kom upp här? När han köpte landet? Jag tror han såg landet innan han köpte det. Men vad såg han då? Ja, allt wood. Stor, döda skogar. En stor skog följde och slöt igenom. Han slöt igenom och slöt alla skogar. Så det var ingen timbre på landet? Ja, det var stora döda skogar, stor, stora. Men de kunde inte användas för någon? Nej, det var för många, ingen marknad för det. De kunde användas för lomba. Ja, de såg några för lomba, för sina barn. För hans egen användning? Ja. Så i alla fall var landet han köpte då ganska rakt? Ja, det var det. Och rox. Och rox var också stor. Bålgården, stor som en bil. Vad har han... Har han förbjudit sin äldre? Nej, det var hans bror. Och han förbjudit honom att komma här eller att stanna här? Nej, min pappa jobbade på rörelsen. Jag tror han fick så långt som Spokane och kom hit för att se hans bror. Han hade redan köpt tio akor. Här i Vänsterbörj? Och han sa att det här... Och de trodde att det var ganska bra. Jag tror att de tyckte att det var hem till dem i Sverige. Du menar naturen och sådant. Ja. Men hans bror, hon gick nu på farmen i Nordacora. De gav honom inte för framtiden? Och varför säljde han det? Han var en vandrar. Han gick till att se på ett nytt land, jag tror. Så han ville inte stanna här? Vinter var kallt. Ja, kall snö där bak. Kall vinter. Så han var en enda när han kunde se på det här? Ja. Ja, tillbaka i norrkorea. Hade han några fler bror och sista? Ja. Sista och fem. De var redan borta i norrkorea. Några i Minnesota och andra i Nebraska. Men du var borta i Hamer? Ja, i norrkorea. Så de sålde farmen? Ja, de kom ut den här sidan. De tog kass och... De sålde allt. De bringade inga andra husbilar? Nej, bara kläder och sånt. Inga hårdor? Inga hårdor? Så vad gjorde han då när han kom hit? De hade att bygga en liten hus. Jag kan ha en drick av vatten. Så de hade att bygga... Ja, de hade att bygga en liten... De kallade dem skäckar. Och de byggde en liten barn och bröt några kall för mjölk. Så de kunde bygga en större hus. Var han fortfarande kallad hans räddor? Nej, han gick alls ut. Han började klara upp 10-åringar land. Han bröt en massa dynamit för att blåta stumporna ut. Hade han nån hjälp från hans bror eller från någon annan? Nej, ibland hände han en man med hårdor för att hjälpa... ...att blåta stumporna ut. Hur kunde han göra en huvud? De hade bara en del att göra efter att han sålde den här barnen. De hade en del dollar att kastas några år. Och så sålde de kring, du vet. Det var en vagn som gick runt och fick upp kringen. Så då, kan du ihåg, när du började få 6-7 kall? Hur många kall hade han? En kall senare. Han hade nog 6-7 kall eller något sånt. Men han kunde inte få dem på 10-åringar? Nej, de kunde klara upp landet och kasta gräset. Kasta gräset i barnet. Men jag vet inte hur de gjorde det första året. Det tog 7 år innan de kunde... ...få tillgång till kallet. Det finns i det här litet papper, de var väldigt satisifierade med första årets krav på kall. Men det kunde inte vara så bra. Så har han kastat mer land än det här? Nej, han kastade bara 10-åringar. Det var allt? Hade han en hår? Nej, han hittade för hjälp. Så han hade aldrig kastat en hår? Nej, han hade aldrig en hår. Han ville jobba lite. De hittade ofta någon som skulle komma in med ett team. Men kunde han verkligen få 6 kall? Ja, han hade upp till 6 kall. De kunde ofta hitta dem lätt. Det var gräs som kunde vara runt i hudarna. Så de kunde hitta dem? Så de kunde ha mer än 10-åringar? De kunde gå ner på de stora medlen. Och äta gräs. Och de kunde gräsa länge? Ja. För att de inte fick för mycket snö här uppe? Nej, inte så mycket snö. Hur är frysen? Ja, det blir lite kallt här ibland. Men fryset går inte ner för långt? Nej, bara några inuti. Så hur lång tid var du i det första huset de byggde? Vi byggde i det där, om vi ser, från 1911-1917. 1911-1917? Ja, och vi byggde till Kalifornien. Så han byggde en hus i det här? Ja, han byggde en hus. Men du byggde? Ja, vi byggde iväg. Vi byggde till Kalifornien. Säljde du landet här? Nej, det var fortfarande där. Men det bröt upp i 19... Var det inte en stor fyr på 25? Ja, ungefär. På 1925 bröt en fyr upp i byggnaderna. Så till Kalifornien? Vi byggde ner, ja. Han gick bra här. Ja, min mor fick lite av sin bröder i Kalifornien. Var i Kalifornien? Bakersfjell, Kalifornien. Det var en avend? Ja. Vi byggde upp i en fyr där. Min äldre hade en hot spring där. Så vi byggde upp i en fyr på 40 milers öster bakersfjell. Vad menar du med hot spring? Mineralspring, hot water coming out of the ground. En helsresort? Ja, en helsresort, för rumetism. Så din mor och din pappa kunde ta bort den? Ja. Så var det en vänster på en affär? Ja, många kom där. Det var en stor oljepåg, Bakersfjell. Det var en stor oljepåg, oljepåg runt omkring. Så folk kom upp där. För att ta hotbath? Ja, ta en hot bath. De kom upp och stod en vecka, eller de stod tre veckor. Så det var då du minns på hotbath? Ja. För att du hade att hjälpa dem att skruva upp bakten. Så du hade full service då? Ja. Så de kom tillbaka varje år och tog dem in? Ja. Hur många år fortsatte de deras affär? Vi var där, folk stod där för 17 år. 17 år? Ja, till 1934. Och du kastade fortfarande det här? Ja, vi kastade aldrig. Och då var din pappa redo för att ta bort den? Ja, han ville komma tillbaka igen. Här? Ja, i 1934. Det var då det kom till depression? Ja, precis efter det. Han ville komma tillbaka igen. Var det business släkt då det kom till depression? Ja, det kom lite slå. De tog det över till sina barn och barn? Ja, brännen och sista. Och det business. Så de tog över. Vad hände då? Var du där? Jag kom upp här med folk. De skulle få tillbaka. Och jag skulle gå upp här och leva med dem. Och hjälpa dem. Så, men du sa att de halserna bröt på 1925? Ja. Hals och barn. Så då kunde du börja med det? Så att jag kunde köpa det här. Det hade de gamla byggnaderna på. Jag ser det. Så du kunde inte bygga dem? Nej, bara för att förbättra dem. Redo dem, modella dem. Så då var han i retirement? Ja, han ville inte göra någon förbättring. Nej, han ville inte. Så då kom du till Vänsterborg? I 1934, ja. Och den kyrkan här i Vänsterborg, var det en kvarnerskyrka? Ja, det var en kvarnersk kyrka. En svensk mission. Det började bli en kvarnersk kyrka. Det har en historia av sin egen. Båda kyrkarna. Det var en del från våra liv. Ja, men du var med i den kyrkan här? Ja, i... 1950 var vi med i den kyrkan. Ja, jag tror det var så. Så dina pappa var med i den? De var med, men de var utrymda. Så det var ingen utrymda kyrka i Vänsterborg? Nej, det var bara det metodiska. Det var en svensk missionkyrka och ett metodiskt episkopiskt kyrka. De tog två kyrkarna och komponenterade dem. De tog ut kyrkan och är nu helt independerade. Independerade kyrka. Och du stod på och träffade din främsta kvinna, Ampere i Vänsterborg. Och sen kan vi prata om... Esther Katrina Moberg. Du var född i Forsgren. Ja. Och dina pappa kom från... Du var född i Portland, Arjen. Men dina pappa kom från Bålstadbruk i Ungermalandsviden. Och de blev inmärkande med två siffror i 1903. Ja. Så du träffade din hund. Ja. Och du var här i Vänsterborg när han tillbaka från Kalifornien. Ja. Jag jobbade i Portland. Ja. Och mina folk var fortfarande här i Vänsterborg. Ja. Och så träffade vi oss på sociala sammanhang i Vänsterborg. Oh. Så vad hände med din jobb då? När du tillbaka? Jag försökte göra lite farming. Farming? Ja, jag tillbaka till minst Moberg. Vilken farming var det? Var det en bra land som de sålde? Det var däri och kakor. Däri och kakor. Hur är sojlet då? Är det en typ av kärn eller? Det är kärn. Kärnsojlet. Inte så bra. Inte så bra? Nej. Var det tappsojlet som stängde? Det var bra för de första några år och då... ...och det blev dåligt. Grönkade av. Så alla farmer här som köpte land från landkommandet hade att göra lite grubbning. Kläder landet. Kläder landet. Det var en bakbordning. Ja, det var det. Allt med händer. Och dynamit. Så de har spunt mer pengar på dynamit än på frukor. De har nog. De första några år. Vad sa de som var gamla om landet? Sade de att de fick en dålig del eller var de glada över det? Några av dem trodde att det var okej. Hur var det med vännerna? Som din mamma, var de... De var inte så glada över det. För de hade... ...se, min mamma kom från en stor farm i Sverige. Där de hade en fin stor farm. Tumulilla. I det där. Men de... Jag tror de beslutade att sätta sig ner och skaffa sig över det. De var pionerar. De hade många tuffa tider. Men dina päror stod här innan de... Ja, vi stod här till 1917. Ja, men när de kom tillbaka 1934. Ja, de stod här. De stod här innan de död. Och de är bryd här i Vänniska Borg. I cemeteriet. Och några av dina päror gick tillbaka till Sverige för en besökning? Nej, de gick inte. Tog de mycket om Sverige? Ja, de pratade ganska mycket. Kanske lite. Tog de svenska hela tiden? När min far och unge gick ihop pratade de svenska. De pratade om Sverige på alla tidningar. Alla saker de hade gärna gärna gärna gärna gärna gärna. Har de gärna sammanhangar under året? Har folk kommit ihop för poliser? Ja. Alla på svenska. Kulgården var alla på svenska. Jag var konfirmad på svenska. Jag kunde inte veta svenska, egentligen inte engelska, innan jag gick till skolan. Så du och Mrs. Måberg, Esther Katrina, när du träffade dina... ...som vi kallar det i svenska, svärföräldrar, eller dess päror. Var du som pratade svenska med dem? Nej. Du var aldrig på svenska i den tiden? Nej. Karls mamma pratade med mig i svenska och jag pratade med henne i engelska. Hon pratade med dig i svenska? Ja, hon levde med oss i många år. Hon pratade mycket svenska med mig. Min egen folk pratade svenska hela deras liv när de var tillsammans. Vad de gjorde? Min far dör när han var 92, men min mor dör när hon var 74. Men upp till då var min far inte med. De pratade svenska hela tiden i hemlandet. De använde aldrig engelska? Det var bara när en kompani kom. Det var inte svenska. Så, jag ska berätta om att de kom från Borsta, Ruk, Ånermaland. Varför kom de? De hade familjer i Portland som sa att tiderna var mycket bättre i USA än där. Min far jobbade i en pulpmiljus i Veja. Han fick en så låg säljare än vad familjerna i USA fick. De kom över till. De kom direkt till Portland, Oregon. Jag har alla detta skrivit ner i min livsforskare här. Om du vill att jag kan skriva av det här. Varför inte du skriver några av dina skärmar? Vilken typ av jobb var de på relationen i Portland? I skärmar, mest. Men det är det här också. De gjorde rätt bra pengar. Ja, en dollar per timme. Ska jag prata nu? Det var en hård dag i augusti 1903. När Jonas Forsgren, hans vän Olivia och sina två son Peter och Carl kom till Portland, Oregon. I exklusiva direktioner som gav dem månader innan. De vann från Union station, borde en städkär, nummer 21. Gick ifrån på 23rd och Uppsjö st. Vann halv block till ett specifikt hus och knuffade på dörren. Det var öppet av en vän som de hade sett i Sverige i sin hemvillighet. Den vän som hade varit i USA ett år nu och skrivit dem de här direktionerna. De hade följt dem utan att veta eller säga en svar i engelsk. Det var en vänlig end till en lång och tröjande resa. Det tog sex veckor att flytta från Bolsta-Bruggen i norrländska Sverige till Portland, Oregon. Det var bara efter sju års skapning och skimpning hade de kunnat skapa tillräckligt mycket pengar för att köpa tika för familjen. Carl var 4,5 år och kunde gå på halvfärd, men Peter var 6 och skulle behöva en fullfärd. I order to have enough money, they lied about his age, saying he was 5. Olivia, being an honest person, was conscious stricken for many years about this. They sailed across the channel to England in a small fishing boat landing in Liverpool, then by train across England to Hull. This took a whole day in a crowded, un-air-conditioned car with no toilet facilities, no food and no water. By the end of the day, the stench was unbearable. Olivia fed her children bread and cheese from the supplies she carried in a basket. She tried to survive in the foul air by sniffing on the perfume a friend had given her as a farewell present. They left England on a cattle steamer. This ship was used for hauling cattle from Canada and returning with immigrants. Jonas and his family were traveling third class, which was one deck above steerage deck. The barn smell was evident whenever anyone opened the passageway to this deck. Many Russian immigrants traveled steerage to America. The trip across the Atlantic was comfortable enough. One meal was furnished, the bunks were ample and the air was fresh on the top deck. The boat docked at Quebec and after passing through customs, which was a frightening experience, because men and women were separated and searched, they boarded a train for the west coast. It took eight days to go across Canada. Since they did not have money for a pullman, they had to sit up all night. It was easier on the children as they slept on the floor. Food was a problem as most of their money was gone. Fruit was bought at the towns where the train stopped and the cheese and hardtack held out. Changing trains in Seattle, they arrived in Portland with exactly 37 cents in their pockets. After resting a few days, Jonas started to look for work. He got a job right away working for the railroad, sweeping out boxcars. His pay was 75 cents a day for 12 hours work. It was later raised to one dollar and 75 cents a day. With his first paycheck, he bought an American flag, which is still in the family. It wasn't just a little flag like those waved in a parade. It measured four feet by six feet. The next paycheck was for a sewing machine with payments of five dollars a month. Soon a house was rented and borders were taken in to help financially. Time flew by and after six years a baby boy arrived whom they named Gustav. Then after three years, about three years later, a baby girl came whom they named Esther. This is where my life begins. When I was about three years old, my father and mother decided they would like to live in the country. They read an ad in the Swedish paper which they were taking, which told of a Swedish colony that was going to be started in Clark County, Washington. To get to this place they had to ferry across the Columbia River, take a trolley car to Sifton and then by horse and buggy another 15 miles to Vännersberg, the name of the settlement. The forested hills reminded them of their home in northern Sweden. They liked the idea of living among Swedish people, so they bought ten acres of land. The land was covered with virgin timber and had to be cleared before any crops could be planted. They were young and courageous. Soon a house was built and buildings for pigs, chickens and the lumber was there for a barn for the cow. A year passed quickly and another baby was born, my sister Elsie. She holds the distinction of being the first baby born in Vännersberg. My father was now working with the surveyor, plating out the rest of the settlement. Many Swedish people had now bought land and had built houses. And then the fire came, one of the Yakult burns which turned thousands of acres of beautiful timber to ashes. I was too young to remember the fire, but it has been told me so many times by my folks that I know it by heart. It was a very hot and dry August and the woods were timber, tinder dry. A stiff east wind started to blow and the sparks from the logging equipment started it all. My father was not at home and my mother became alarmed when the ashes started flying by and she could hear the roar of the flames. She instructed the older boys to turn the cow out, to open the chicken yard door and to let the two pigs out of their pen. She realized there wasn't time to linger and she knew the only safe place to go was to the farm that had a big pond, known as headquarters. She took time to take the box of sterling silver she had brought from Sweden and instructed Peter to bury it in the orchard. Then she and Carl took the precious sewing machine and placed it in the plowed field near the house. Carrying the baby in her arms and with me riding piggyback on my oldest brother we started running for headquarters. We got there in time and most of the villagers were there already. They had formed a bucket brigade and were passing water from the pond and wetting down the roof of the house. The fire struck with a roar and passed as quickly and the house and the people were safe. My father came running in, much relieved to find us safe. Smoke filled the air and ashes covered the ground. We spent the night there. Morning finally came. It was a sad sight. All the beautiful timbered hills were now black. Trees were still afire. Many had been uprooted from the wind and as we walked home there was nothing left. Only the sewing machine scorched but still good. My brother had marked the spot where he had buried the silver with a wooden stake which had burned. Some of this silver was found when the field was plowed. The pigs were back rooting in the ashes. They had found the silver and they all came home. They all came home by themselves and then they were milked and then fed in the barn. They raised enough hay. My folks never bought hay. They raised enough what we called kale. That was a green plant that grows about that high. It is something in the cabbage family. That would not freeze during the winter. When we had a little snow they would just shake the snow off and bring that in. They fed that to the cattle all winter long. My father was an inventor of sorts. He had a blacksmith shop on the place. As I said he wasn't a farmer but he could do things with iron. After he got a hold of a gasoline engine he put up a mill where he ground wheat and oats. He put up a mill where he ground wheat and oats. For cattle feed. Farmers all around them started letting their grain ripen and brought the grain to my father's mill. So he earned a little money that way. He made himself a wood saw with a gasoline engine so that he could saw up people's wood. This was on wheels so he could take the horses and haul his little sawmill to people's farms. He would saw their winter wood. He was not a lazy person even though he didn't like farming. He was always inventing something. So you had to be inventive to live in the place like this. He was also a barber. All the men around would come and mostly they traded work. You've got two horses and I only have one. You bring your horses up and plow and I'll cut your hair for a year. So there was barbers. A lot of that. So when you went to the store you only bought the most important things. Sugar, salt. What kind of heating was wood of course? Yes. Kerosin. And the lantern. Kerosin lantern. You may have that. They are looking for 1200 able bodied men to sell this kind of economy and they will go forward. How many did sell here? How many all told? 300 men sold them after. They didn't get more than maybe 30 families. 30 families. Not more than that would you say? Originally. Well they are almost all here speaking except maybe the bachelors. Our house you see burned down in the fire. This house that we had first burned down in the fire. And so that set us back. And the barn and everything. Complete loss. They had not had time to build a barn but they had the stacks of lumber brought out by horse and wagon from town to build a barn. And the whole stack of lumber burned up. The brand new house just one year old burned up and everything we ever owned in there. Including all immigration papers, all of the marriage certificates and everything from Sweden. Every bit of that burned up. And so we did have an awful time when my father then retired and applied for pension. And we had to find his birth date, record, birth certificate. We had nothing of that kind. There was nothing in the church book. No, the church didn't keep that record. I had to write to the church in Sweden and Bolstabruk and get an affidavit telling when they immigrated, when they were born and when they were married and the birth date of the children. And that's how we got that. But it was pretty hard to get. I went to Washington, I wrote to Washington DC to the immigration department there. They had no record of our folks entering the United States. I wrote to the place in Washington where they came across Canada by rail and the little town where they crossed over from Canada into the United States had no record of them ever entering the United States. I could not prove that my father and mother had ever left Sweden until we got the affidavit from Sweden. Then when my brothers needed that same information to get their citizenship paper, that was the same problem. They started school in Portland and the schools had no record as far back as 1903. At least they hadn't kept the records. The place I got the records to prove that they were there was in the Lutheran Church in Portland where they had gone to Sunday school. My mother went to church there in Portland. The Lutheran Church gave me the information necessary so they got their citizenship. But how about your father? Didn't he belong as a member to the Portland Lutheran Church? No, not until they were out here. How many feminists were stricken by this bad fire? Was it in the summertime? It was in August. A dry, hot August. Not everybody's house burned down because the wind was so terrific, I would say it was 70-80 miles an hour, came from the east and right through the big forest. All these trees and then the little houses underneath them. Except some houses that just blew right over them. Our house burned up here and this house over here wasn't touched. So everybody didn't lose this house, but I would say about 60% of the houses burned down. All that virgin timber burned up. Then the snags were all black and they burned for months afterwards. But they had to saw them down and instead of being able to sell them for lumber to the little sawmill they had built down here, they split them up and burned great big fires of beautiful lumber in their fields, clearing land. One tree would have built half of a house. Did the summer families leave then after that blow? No, more came. The ones that lost everything, they were ready to start? All over again. They were young, around 30 or so, younger, somewhere 24 and in there they were young people. They stayed. Why they bought land out here that was so hard to farm and they all thought they should farm? I don't know which direction you came from. Seattle? Portland. You came all through that nice level land between Portland and here? Was they already taken? Most of it was taken. By other emigrants? So now if you go into this name, where did they come from? Have you ever heard, like your parents, did they talk about it? They didn't say how, there are so many arguments about this name. Tell them to call again. What did you want? Different from the Venice boy in Sweden. Well, but there was family there a year ago. There was no Swedish family. Some people say there was an immigrant from Venice boy Sweden that settled here. And that is not so, there never was. And then some place in the paper I read when they were trying to get the history of Vännersberg, that there was a man named Venner and they named it after him and there never was that. I know that. And so the only thing, and this is what I tell people because that is what I like about it. Now, en vän is a friend in Sweden, isn't it? V-E-N, vän, is a friend in Sweden. And a borg, a borg is a kind of a haven, a safety place, a refuge. And so I translated it as a friendly place to be, a friendly safe place to be, a friendly village or a friendly, what shall I call it, refuge. A haven? Yes, kind of a haven for people who are friends, a friendly haven. That is what I tell people because I like the connotation of those words put together. Vänner, en vän, flera vänner, is that right? Vännersborg. Vännersborg? So you, you never met anybody from the area? No, the people who made, who bought the land and made the colony here named it. But why or what for, I don't know. And nobody that I know about. The Swedish Land Company? Named it, Swedish Land and Development Company. The Vännerberg and Andersson? Yeah, they named it. And it was named, they came out and bought the land from the railroad. This belonged to the railroad. And it was named after the railroad? No, nothing. And there were some homesteaders, in fact there were three or four homesteaders, and they had never named it at all either. It wasn't a village, it wasn't a town. And they lived in the Portland, Landerberg and Andersson? Yes, until they started building here. Then they went to this one house that they had bought here and lived there for a couple of years while they sold all this. But they didn't belong to any church or anything? No, they didn't at all. What happened to those people afterwards? Did they leave the area? Well, when these people, I guess they started thinking they were being defrauded. And so they started making it a little bit hot for them there, give me my money back and things. And they just spewed. Well, you mean some of the residents here? Yeah, I think, uh-huh. Yes, and they had a big office in Portland where they were doing this. And they would put these ads about the wonders of Vännersberg in Chicago newspapers, in any place where there were Swedes. They would tell about Cherklund, then Svenska Kolonien. You see, in all the old Swedes that I'd buy, that'd be a nice place to be. So there were other people in Kvarvard, then, who came here? And a lot of them bought land without ever coming out to look at it. And when they came out and saw it, and saw it was impossible to make a living on it, that's what, now that's just my opinion. Then they started fighting about it, yes. And so Lannerberg, there was a big scandal about Lannerberg and his office. And they just disbanded and disappeared. Went some other place and got other people's money. Just disappeared. As far as I don't know. Didn't one go to Seattle Anderson? And there wasn't a shooting going on, too. There was some little... Somebody got the hot on it. Yes, and so they decided they'd better clear out. And in those days, they didn't go to any lawyers or any place to help them out. They just let it go. Well, I suppose after they paid... Your father, he paid $50 an acre. Yes. So this is $500 then? So after that, after that, there was no more money left for the lawyers, I suppose? No, and my father, they weren't fighting people. They just took it and made the most of it. Did they stick it out now, most likely your parents and your parents? No. They didn't stay as long as my folks did. They started moving to where they could get work. They would go to Portland mostly. Was this place too far away then in that time to get work? Horse and buggy. So you had to stay there overnight? It took, yes. You had to take your horse to Sifton and they had a trolley. Your horse to Sifton and they had a trolley car from Vancouver to Sifton. That's about halfway. Then you took the ferry across the Columbia River into Portland. And then they had a street car, a trolley car, that came to the ferry landing. And that was another 10-15 miles into the city of Portland. So you see, that was a whole day's journey just to get there. Then you had to stay overnight there if you wanted to buy supplies or visit relatives or something. You couldn't come back the same way. And they had a livery stable in Sifton where you rented your buggy and horses. And drove out here. It was very, very hard to go because the mud and the roads were hub deep in the wintertime because of the rain. So this road out here now, I mean it's beautiful to travel up and down. How was it in your time then when you were growing up here? Was it muddy or...? They had split timber and laid the split timber with the flat side down and the round side up. So it was a road made out of timber. In the wet places? All over, the whole way. The whole way from our store down here down to where the gravel road started down by. Before they had timber, the landowners had it? They had a little sawmill here. So they had to have a little organization then? I don't think the county did it. No. No, I think the people here did it. They also made their own telephone line. Got their posts and bought their wire and they strung it all the way from here. Cleared down the orchards which is half way to Vancouver. And it was also by the Senors? Yes, they called it the Veniceburg Telephone Company. How did they... Well you probably call Noah more of the road work than she does. Because you were probably on a splitting... No, he was gone. It was before your time. Yes. Well it must be harder to assess. You know, you're supposed to take care of that piece and you're supposed to take care of that. How did they... The maintenance there wasn't very good. In the rainy season, we had so much rain, those timbers started floating away. And they would be floating on top of the water. And they would be floating on the water and you'd walk on them and they'd splash. I can remember that. I can't remember who put them there. That was before my memory time too. I can't remember how it was put on there. But it lasted quite a few years though. Oh yes, it did. It lasted a long time. Of course, and buggy and... Could you use any sleds in the winter here or was there no snow enough? No, no, no, no snow. Just a few inches. I remember in this area there was my horse and... And wagon. And wagon. Then if we go over to Swedish, Mrs. Morberg here, because I know you speak very good Swedish and you've got to understand it. You also understand Swedish, right? Yes, I can understand it. Well, we'll start with the home. The one that your mother built. The one that you built in the morning. What time did you get up? Oh, maybe 6 in the morning. She sat in the living room then? And then the coffee? Dad always made the fire in the living room and cooked coffee and took a cup of coffee to mom in her bedroom. And offered her coffee in the bed? Yes, yes, he always did that. So that's it. And then she had to get up and cook breakfast for the family. And when the breakfast was ready... What was the breakfast made of? A lot of Swedish breakfast. Most of it was porridge. Seafood porridge? Yes, seaweed porridge. And what she called slät porridge. It was like cream of wheat. And slät porridge? Yes, and then she took on her camp clothes and went out to the camp and milked maybe 7 cows. While you were eating and the kids were going to school. Yes, and then dad was inside and helped us with breakfast and clothes to get ready for school. Yes. What did dad do in the camp now? Then he cleaned the barn. Yes, and what did he call it? What did he call it? What did he call it when he threw out the porridge, for example? I don't remember. The drink? What did they say they did? Knocked them out? I don't remember. I don't remember. And then he took the porridge from the barn and gave it to the cows. Was that upstairs? It was upstairs. What did he call it? He called it a special name. That he was going to go up there. The loft. I don't remember what he called it. And then after the milk was done, he had what we call a separator. The milk came in and out like porridge in one place and milk in the other. And that's what dad did? Yes, he had to do it by hand. And we as children were helped by that? When we were older. It was a time when we were the same speed. And then the porridge was sold for, what shall I say, once a week. A man came with a horse and a cart and took all the porridge. And it stood there for so long? Yes, it became sour but it didn't do anything because it made cheese out of it. And then the milk that was left was given to the pigs, the small pigs and the family used it. And then mom came in after the milk, she had to do the dishes after breakfast. Yes, then dad went out and maybe ordered the garden and such work. And maybe cleared the land. This was in the wintertime? Yes, when he was home he was out. And then you drank coffee for ten hours? Yes, we did that and then we had skarpor. With coffee. Only skarpor? Yes, mostly that. And then when we were in school we had lunch at twelve o'clock. And we came home from school and we had to walk an English mile. Then we always had coffee and some soup with it. And you also got coffee as a child? Yes, as a child when we came home from school. How old were you when you started drinking coffee? Oh, seven or eight years. So that was common? It was common. In all homes? Yes, I think so. And then in the evening it was almost the same. Milk, porridge and food. And then it was homework in the kitchen with the oil lamp. But at dinner time you ate a big dinner? Yes, potatoes and vegetables. What did they have for vegetables before? No, we had carrots. Everything was cooked? Yes, and green beans and peas. And corn. Corn? Yes. So there was no raw vegetables? Maybe cabbage. And cabbage? Yes, we thought about that. And we always had a lot of fruit. Apples and pears. Did you have dessert? Yes. So you went to dinner or to the table? Did your dad or mom read a meal plan? The children did. Not the elderly? No, the children did it all the time. And how was it? It was just a small verse we had learned when we were very little. Give name to the food we go. Bless God with the food we get. Bless and in the same way, your precious word to the soul. Amen. And that's mom's turn? Yes, and we said that in turn. In turn. For a meal plan. So for example, you read once and your sister read next time. And that's how it was. And mom baked all her own bread. We had two times a week she had to bake bread. Because that was a pile of food for us. So a lot of flour. And you ate a lot of bread and butter. Did she say butter? Yes, butter. Never a sandwich? Always butter? And you ate that for dinner? Yes. Did you have cheese on top? No, we didn't have much cheese. We had cheese. No, we didn't have cheese. We had salt. Salty? Yes, salty. I mean jam or jelly. On our bread. Marmelade as they say on the menu. That is used a lot. And then after dinner we go back to the dishes. After when we got older. So then we have to do the dishes. But the water we have to carry in from a cell. A piece. And we have to heat it up before we can bathe or wash the dishes. And bathe in the kitchen? Yes. We took the time to do that. How often did you bathe? Once a week. Whether we needed it or not. Was that the end of the week? It was on Saturday night. Saturday night? Yes, that was the rule. After dinner? Yes. And mom and dad bathed when all the children went to bed. They took the bath? Yes. And then they heated the water on the stove. What did mom say? She didn't call it the stove for the stove. No, that was funny. Spisen is stove in English. So it became the stove. The stove. And the bottom is gate in English. So it became the gate. So half Swedish and half English in many many words. Yes. The one on the spis plate over there was called that. Up on the stove. Yes. I don't remember what it was. I don't remember. Spiskroken. Spiskroken. I don't remember what she called it. I don't remember. You don't remember? No. And the coffee pot? I don't remember. I don't remember. What did she call it? Teakettle. No, I don't know. And the coffee pot was called cups? Do you use the English word? No, it was cups. It was cups? Yes. What did she call it? The smoke that goes up from the stove? The stove. The chimney. The pipe. The pipe. I don't remember either. I don't remember. What was it? And the bench? Did she say the bench? We didn't have a bench. And the table? The table. She used another word. So it was the table. And the chair? The chair. She didn't say the chair. No. No, it was just the table and the chair. And the floor. The roof and the walls. But the kitchen was the gate. And the kitchen was the chair. Did you use all of that expression? No, there were many who had only Swedish in their home. They said it was the kitchen? Yes. How did it come to be that some families used... I think most families lived in the cities before they came to Vännesborg. So they could speak more English than my family. In Portland, where my parents lived, there was a small section of the town where all of the people were Swedish and many from Valsdabruk. My dad learned English much faster because he was out at work. But the women were only with their Swedish friends. But now, like Karls mother, she worked in a school for boys. She was a cook there. So she learned English much faster than my mother. Did she speak Swedish to you? Yes. For example, when they got angry at you, did you do something? Yes. What did they say? Did they say something bad? I remember one expression, but it was, how little you have. It's probably a native language, but it means, how foolish you are. And you understand what it means? Yes. We hadn't treated us as we should because we were old. There were so many Johnsons, so many Petersons, so many Svensons. There was Apple Svensson because he had a big apple orchard. There was Canada Anderson because he came from Canada. There was Cuba Johnson because he came from Cuba. He had been in Cuba? Yes, he had been in Cuba. I'd like to ask you a question. And then there was Crazy Johnson because he had tried to kill somebody. Well, I can't think of any right now. But they named them for what kind of people they were, where they came from, and what their occupation was.
